# lect

A simple recorder for lectures and presentations.
Currently in early stages of development. 

Traditionally, information in technical subjects (mathematics, physics, ...)
was shared using chalk and a blackboard. This simple medium is surprisingly
efficient and *lect* is a modern take on this approach.
