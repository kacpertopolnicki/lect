# lect

A simple recorder for lectures and presentations.
Currently in early stages of development. 

Traditionally, information in technical subjects (mathematics, physics, ...)
was shared using chalk and a blackboard. This simple medium is surprisingly
efficient and *lect* is a modern take on this approach. 

# todo

1) add tests
2) strengthen immutability of State
   - verify that they don't change (images are not copied, 
     can you make a numpy array immutable?)
3) pickle some records and use this for tests
4) make the code after ctrl-s ctrl-a parallel
5) add documentation
6) setup code structure for pip
7) add tutorial to README.md
8) configure key shortcuts in config file
9) remove most calls to logger.debug
10) read todos in code
